## Desktop installation

1. On installing Ubuntu choose *"Something else"* to have access to the partitioner.

2. If the drive was used before, remove the partition table or delete partitions to hold your Ubuntu. All data on these partitions will be deleted.

3. Create a new partition to hold the OS root directory.

4. Choose the mount point `/` for this root partition:

   ![boot](/home/marina/Desktop/desktop_installation/images/boot.png)

5. Repeat step 3. and 4. for the `/home` partition:

![home](/home/marina/Desktop/desktop_installation/images/home.png)

In case there is a pre-existing HOME partition holding data we now have to **make sure to untick"Format?"** before we proceed with the installation to not delete this data:

6. Choose *"Install now"* to partition and format the drive and proceed with the installation.
